long_description:  This program is the last in a series of python scripts screening for circulating strains of a target organism that, theoretically, may go undetected by lab-developed PCR assays. Using blastn results of a fasta file of amplicon sequences against the assay oligonucleotides and a fasta file of primers/probe, oligonucleotide hybridization sites are extracted from the amplicon sequence and concatenated in the correct order (i.e. forward primer - probe - reverse primer). Concatenated sequences are then organized into unique sequence grouping, in which sequevars map to lists of sequences containing the sequevar. These sequences can optionally be compared to a list of trusted sequences so that any sequences identical to those in the trusted 'safelist' will be ignored. The remainder are printed to fasta (with one representative sequence per sequevar grouping) as well as to a textual summary.
